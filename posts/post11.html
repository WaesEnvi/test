                <h3>Theta Apodis</h3>

                <p>Theta Apodis is a variable star in the southern circumpolar constellation of Apus. It is a variable star with an apparent visual magnitude range of 4.65 to 6.20, which, according to the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale, means it is a faint star but visible to the naked eye from dark suburban skies. The distance to Theta Apodis is approximately 350 light-years (110 parsecs), based upon parallax measurements made from the Gaia telescope. It is unusual in that it is a red star with a high proper motion (greater than 50 milliarcseconds a year).
                    <br><br>
This is an evolved red giant that is currently on the asymptotic giant branch, with a stellar classification of M7 III. It shines with a luminosity approximately 3879 times that of the Sun and has a surface temperature of 3,131 K. It is a semiregular pulsating variable and its brightness changes over a range of 0.56 magnitudes with a period of 119 days. A longer period of around 1,000 days has also been detected. It is losing mass at the rate of 1.1 × 10−7 times the mass of the Sun per year through its stellar wind. Dusty material ejected from this star is interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium, forming a bow shock as the star moves through the galaxy. The stand-off distance for this front is located at about 0.134 ly (0.041 pc) from Theta Apodis.
                    <br><br>
Theta Apodis has been identified as an astrometric binary, indicating that it has an orbiting companion that causes gravitational perturbation of the primary star.</p>
